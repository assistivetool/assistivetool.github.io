            <h3>TODO</h3>
            The project is still in its very early infancy. I hope to get work on it as soon as possible. In the meanwhile, the following ToDo-List needs to be worked on for preparation:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Find a low-cost and high-availability USB camera module with acceptable resolution</li>
                <li>Find a compatible, low-cost and high-availability zoom lens for the camera, preferably with autofocus</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <br><br>

        <div>
            <h3>Why Assistive<i>Tool</i>?</h3>
            The long-term goal of the project is to provide accessibility solutions for any kind of disability that perfectly integrate with each other.
